# Changelog

All notable changes to the `cal.diy` fork are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this fork
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Upstream (Cal.com) tracks
its own versioning under `v6.x`; the fork moves to `v7.x` to mark its independent line.

## [7.3.1] — 2026-08-17

Closes the last `high` advisory v7.3.0 left open, on `nodemailer` — bumped
7.0.12 → 9.0.5.

The advisory: the message-level `raw` option bypassed `disableFileAccess` /
`disableUrlAccess`, allowing arbitrary file read and full message forgery
(fixed in 9.0.1). The bump also clears five more advisories on the same
package — SMTP command injection via `envelope.size` and via CRLF in the
transport name, CRLF injection in `List-*` header comments, a `jsonTransport`
bypass of the same file/url access flags, and improper TLS certificate
validation when fetching OAuth2 tokens.

Three breaking changes sit between the two versions; none applies here:

- `8.0.0` renames error code `NoAuth` to `ENOAUTH` — neither is referenced in
  this repository.
- `9.0.0` makes remote content fetches validate TLS certificates by default
  (attachment `href`/`path`, OAuth2 token endpoints, proxy `CONNECT`). The two
  templates that attach transcripts fetch them themselves and pass a `Buffer`
  as `content`, so nodemailer issues no request of its own; `icalEvent` is
  likewise inline through `generateIcsFile`; and `detectTransport()` produces
  neither an OAuth2 transport nor a proxy. Distinct from the SMTP connection's
  own `tls.rejectUnauthorized`, which this change does not touch and which
  stays driven by `serverConfig` — self-hosters on a self-signed SMTP
  certificate are unaffected.
- `7.0.0` (SESv2 SDK) predates the version in use.

`@types/nodemailer` moved 6.4.5 → 8.0.1 in the same pass, the old types still
describing nodemailer 6. Nodemailer still ships no types of its own, so the
`@types` package remains necessary.

Production advisories 106 → 100, highs 29 → 28. No new advisory. Verified with
`type-check:ci` (9/9), `TZ=UTC yarn vitest run packages/emails
packages/features/auth/lib` (129 green across 13 files), and Biome.

## [7.3.0] — 2026-08-17

Fork synchronised with `upstream/main` up to #29940, and the security
`resolutions` block brought back up to date.

### Upstream sync

Nineteen commits cherry-picked with `-x`; `git cherry` confirmed the other
twenty-eight upstream commits were already applied to the fork. Notable ones:
`parseIpFromHeaders` now trims whitespace (#29857) — untrimmed headers let a
crafted `X-Forwarded-For` slip past the IP banlist; all seat payments are
refunded when a paid seated booking is cancelled (#29685); cancelled bookings
send `METHOD:CANCEL` in their ICS (#29708); `customReplyToEmail` is no longer
dropped when `hideOrganizerEmail` is set (#29940); `getEventLocationType` is
renamed to `getLocationByType` (#28567).

One conflict, in `markdownToSafeHTML.ts` and `markdownToSafeHTMLClient.ts`:
#29648 rewrites the `.replace()` chain the fork had amended for SEC-203. Both
intents are kept — the fork's `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on every new-tab link
**and** upstream's `h1`/`h2` rendering.

### Security — dependencies

The CI `security-audit` job was already failing: it blocks on
`yarn npm audit --severity critical` and three critical advisories were open.
None of them comes from the sync — no cherry-picked commit touches a manifest.
The cause is that the security `resolutions` block had drifted, several entries
pinning a version that had since become vulnerable (`axios` held at 1.15.0 when
the fix landed in 1.16.0, likewise `tar`, `form-data`, `multer`, `hono`,
`protobufjs`).

- `next-auth` 4.24.13 → 4.24.15 — GHSA-7rqj-j65f-68wh: the email normaliser
  validates the address *before* Unicode normalisation, so an `@` homoglyph
  bypasses account matching on the magic-link flow. The only one of the three
  criticals on a real authentication path, and on a flow this fork already
  hardened (SEC-008).
- `tar` 7.5.11 → 7.5.22 (decompression DoS, via `sqlite3` ← `saml-jackson`) and
  `websocket-driver` 0.7.4 → 0.7.5 (message corruption, via `faye-websocket`).
- Markdown path, widened by #29648 now that headings render: `sanitize-html`
  2.17.0 → 2.17.7 (incomplete URI scheme validation let `javascript:` through
  `action`/`formaction`/`poster`), `dompurify` 3.3.2 → 3.4.13, `linkify-it`
  5.0.0 → 5.0.2 (quadratic DoS on attacker text).
- `next` 16.2.3 → 16.2.12 on `apps/web` — App Router middleware bypass, SSRF via
  rewrites, Server Actions DoS. Docs and example workspaces aligned too: no
  production code, but they accounted for 43 advisories and drowned the signal.
- `axios` 1.19.0, `form-data` 4.0.6, `multer` 2.2.0, `hono` 4.13.2,
  `protobufjs` 7.6.5, `@xmldom/xmldom`, `brace-expansion`, `nanoid` 3.x,
  `js-yaml` 4.3.1, `fast-uri` 3.1.5.

Production advisories 265 → 106; criticals 3 → 0; highs 93 → 29. No new
advisory, no major-version change, no new peer-dependency warning.

### Still open

`nodemailer` stays on 7.0.12 with a `high`: the message-level `raw` option
bypasses `disableFileAccess`/`disableUrlAccess`, allowing arbitrary file read.
The fix requires 9.x — a major on the email path, deliberately left to its own
change. The remaining highs are mostly build-tooling DoS (`vite`, `postcss`,
`glob`, `tmp`, `svgo`) or transitives not reachable from a request.

## [7.2.1] — 2026-07-15

The 2FA login screen returned a bare "something went wrong" for every kind of
failure. The two-factor branch of `authorizeCredentials` had three unguarded
throw sites — `symmetricDecrypt`, `totpAuthenticatorCheck`, and the dynamic
import of `@calcom/lib/totp`. None was caught or logged, so a raw exception
escaped `authorize()` and reached the client as an **unmapped** error code,
which the login view renders through its `t("something_went_wrong")` fallback.
That message is indistinguishable from a wrong password, a wrong code, or a
rate limit, and it left no trace in the logs whatsoever. v7.0.4 instrumented
the OAuth path but left the classic and 2FA branches silent.

Each throw site now logs and maps to a known `ErrorCode`:

- `2fa-secret-decrypt-threw` — key does not match the ciphertext, or corrupt row
- `2fa-totp-check-threw` — bundle import failure, or non-base32 secret
- `2fa-secret-bad-length` — decrypted, but unexpected length
- `incorrect-2fa-code` — genuinely wrong TOTP
- `incorrect-password` / `no-password-hash` — classic credentials path

The decrypt log carries `storedFormat` (`v1-cbc` / `v2-gcm`). A wrong key and a
corrupted row raise the same exception; the payload's format is what tells them
apart.

User-visible change: these failures now surface as `InternalServerError`, which
the client maps to a real message. The previous bare error literally meant
"unrecognised error code".

This release is observability only — it changes no authentication logic.

- `next-auth-options.ts`: catch, log and map the three throw sites; instrument
  the classic credentials path.
- `crypto-clever.ts`: `isLegacyCiphertext` is now read at runtime, so its
  docstring no longer claims it is test-only.
- `next-auth-options.test.ts`: 5 cases, one per mapping. The two covering the
  raw throws fail against the unpatched code.

## [7.0.5] — 2026-05-27

Team invitations were effectively broken end to end. The "Accept invite"
button in the invite email linked to
`/auth/login?callbackUrl=/teams?inviteToken=…`, which (a) targeted `/teams` —
a route that does not exist in this fork (only `/settings/teams`) — and (b)
left the nested `?inviteToken=` unencoded, so it was parsed as a param of
`/auth/login` and dropped. The in-app team list also showed pending invites
with only a "pending" badge and no way to accept them; clicking the row
navigated to the team profile, which threw `FORBIDDEN` and rendered as
"Team not found".

- `inviteMember.handler.ts`: point `joinLink` at the existing `/settings/teams`
  route with a properly URL-encoded `callbackUrl` carrying the invite token.
- `settings/teams` view: add Accept/Decline buttons on pending invites,
  auto-accept the matching invite when arriving via `?inviteToken=`, and stop
  linking pending teams to the profile page (which 403s for non-members).
- `inviteMember.test.ts`: new tests covering the encoded invite link and the
  no-account no-op.

The backend `acceptOrLeave` handler already supported both tokenless in-app
accept and the token defense-in-depth path, so it was unchanged.

## [7.0.4] — 2026-05-23

Follow-up to v7.0.3. The previous fix only triggered when `user.password.hash`
was null, which left **hybrid accounts** broken — e.g. an account created
through email/password that later linked Google. The signIn callback would
correctly redirect those to TOTP, but `authorizeCredentials` then fell into
the classic credentials branch with an empty `password` field and rejected
the login. Discovered in production with `idP=GOOGLE`, `hasPasswordHash=true`,
`twoFactorEnabled=true`.

Authorization mode is now driven by the **presence of `totpToken`**, not by
the absence of a password. The signed JWT (HS256, 2-min TTL, issued by the
signIn callback after the IdP step) is the canonical proof of having
completed OAuth — its presence routes the request through the OAuth+2FA
branch regardless of whether a password is also set on the account.

- `next-auth-options.ts`: split authorize logic into `isOAuthContinuation`
  (totpToken present, JWT verified, idP !== CAL, totpCode present) vs
  classic credentials. Adds instrumentation at every reject point
  (`authorize:entry`, `:user-lookup-result`, `:reject:user-not-found`,
  `:reject:user-locked`, `:reject:rate-limit`, `oauth-2fa-*`) so future
  regressions are diagnosable from logs alone.
- `next-auth-options.test.ts`: new test for the hybrid case
  (password hash + idP=GOOGLE + 2FA + valid JWT → success).

Operational note: this fork's rate limiter (`packages/lib/rateLimit.ts`)
fails closed in production when `UNKEY_ROOT_KEY` is missing or its key lacks
`ratelimit.*` permissions. The same login symptom (`401` with no
`authorize:entry` log) will appear if Unkey returns a permission error,
since `checkRateLimitAndThrowError` runs before any auth logic. See
SEC-200 docstring in `rateLimit.ts`.

## [7.0.3] — 2026-05-22

Hotfix: Google/Azure OAuth users with 2FA enabled could no longer complete login.
Upstream #25563 simplified the credentials provider authorize flow and removed
the branch that allowed OAuth users (no password hash) to authenticate via TOTP
alone. After the IdP step the signIn callback still redirects to
`/auth/login?totp=<signed JWT>`, but the TOTP form submission was then rejected
with `IncorrectEmailPassword` because the user has no password.

We re-allow this path under a stricter contract: the JWT issued by the signIn
callback is now forwarded as a hidden credential (`totpToken`) and re-verified
inside `authorizeCredentials`. The password check is skipped only when (a) the
user has no password hash, (b) `identityProvider !== CAL`, (c) a valid
unexpired JWT (HS256, matching issuer/audience) is supplied, and (d) its email
matches the user. The existing TOTP code check still runs unchanged.

- `packages/features/auth/lib/verifyTotpLoginJwt.ts` (new)
- `packages/features/auth/lib/next-auth-options.ts`: accept `totpToken`; gated
  bypass of password check for OAuth users; preserves all previous reject paths.
- `apps/web/modules/auth/login-view.tsx`: forward `?totp=` query param as
  `totpToken` in `signIn("credentials", …)`. Also seed `email` via
  `useForm({ defaultValues })` when arriving on the TOTP step from the JWT
  redirect — the email input is not rendered in 2FA mode, so without a
  seeded default the Zod schema rejected `email: undefined` and
  `handleSubmit` silently swallowed the click.
- Tests: 4 new cases in `next-auth-options.test.ts` (happy path; email mismatch;
  invalid/expired JWT; CAL user with JWT still rejected). 41/41 passing.

## [7.0.0] — 2026-05-22

Closes the 5-sprint security audit remediation (Sprints 0 → 4). 62 commits, 193 files,
+14 581 / -472 lines. ~47 tickets resolved in code; remaining items deferred to
`audit/OPS_TODO.md` (ops/PM responsibility).

This is a **major** release: several behavioural defaults change in ways that are visible
to operators and end-users. See **Breaking Changes** below.

### Breaking Changes

- **Password minimum length raised from 7 to 12 characters.** Existing users keep their
  passwords; new sign-ups and password resets are rejected below 12. [`SEC-005`]
- **Admin tRPC routes optionally require 2FA** via `REQUIRE_2FA_FOR_ADMIN=true`. Off by
  default in this release; flip after admins enroll. [`SPRINT3-041`]
- **`teams.create` defaults `isPrivate=true`.** Previously public-by-default.
  [`SEC-307+308-FORK`]
- **Per-user team-creation quota.** `MAX_TEAMS_PER_USER` (default 50). [`SEC-303-FORK`]
- **Admin team deletion refuses to drop teams with future ACCEPTED/PENDING bookings**
  unless `force: true` is passed. [`SEC-306-FORK`]
- **`adminList` returns `{ teams, nextCursor }`** instead of a bare array. Callers must
  paginate. [`BUG-101-FORK`]
- **`requireMember` returns `{ id: null, isSyntheticAdmin: true }`** for system admins
  instead of fake `id: -1`. Update any downstream consumers reading `.id` blindly.
  [`BUG-102-FORK`]
- **Avatar / team-image upload caps tightened.** `imageField` 1 MiB → **256 KiB** with
  MIME `refine` (`png|jpe?g|svg+xml|webp`); base64 avatar route hard-capped at 8 MiB with
  PNG/JPEG magic-bytes validation. [`SEC-015`, `SEC-304-FORK`]
- **`/api/logo` capped at 5 MiB** (returns 413 above). [`PERF-011`]
- **Markdown links emit `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`.** [`SEC-203`]
- **CSP enforced on `/auth/login` and `/login`**, Report-Only everywhere else;
  `script-src` reduced to `'nonce-{nonce}' 'strict-dynamic'`. Inline scripts without the
  nonce will be blocked once Report-Only is flipped to enforce. [`SEC-201`, `SEC-205`]
- **Reset-password tokens are atomically consumed** via `updateMany({ where: { id, expires: { gt: now } } })`.
  Tokens are single-use; double-submits return 404. [`BUG-002`]
- **`/api/auth/two-factor/totp/disable` always requires password**, even for OAuth-only
  identities. [`SEC-011`]

### Added

- `FORK-NOTES.md` — branch model, shim pattern, divergence inventory, rebase procedure
  against upstream. [`FORK-301-FORK`]
- `audit/REMEDIATION_STATUS.md`, `audit/OPS_TODO.md` — sprint-by-sprint remediation
  tracking and ops backlog.
- `packages/prisma/migrations/MIGRATIONS.md` — documents the `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`
  pattern and `@prisma:no-transaction` directive. [`BUG-011`]
- `packages/features/audit-log/adminAuditLog.ts` — structured `recordAdminAction` audit
  trail (`granted` / `denied` outcomes, actor, target, reason) wired into every admin
  tRPC handler. [`SEC-305-FORK`]
- `packages/lib/crypto-clever.ts` — externalised AES-256-GCM logic with `v2:` prefix
  shim; reduces `crypto.ts` divergence from upstream to 3 lines. [`FORK-REFACTOR`]
- `packages/trpc/server/routers/viewer/webhook/authorization-clever.ts` — externalised
  webhook authorization helpers; `util.ts` diff vs upstream now ~5 lines. [`FORK-300-FORK`]
- OAuth refresh in-process mutex via `Map<userId::appSlug, Promise>` to coalesce
  concurrent token refreshes. [`SEC-107`]
- SSRF validation for CalDAV and ICS feed URLs. [`SEC-104`]
- Sentry `beforeSend` PII scrubbing with edge-runtime guard. [`RGPD-302`]
- Renovate config with `rangeStrategy: pin` and `@radix-ui/*` grouping. [`SEC-309-FORK`]
- GitHub Actions workflows: Semgrep (OWASP/TS/React/Node/secrets) + CodeQL
  (`security-extended`), both uploading SARIF. [`FORK-302-FORK`]
- `isSillyEnabled(log)` helper guarding hot-path `logger.silly` call sites
  (`EventManager`, `getBusyTimes`). [`PERF-002`]
- DST-aware `getWorkingHours` via optional `forDate` on `relativeTimeUnit`. [`BUG-004`]
- DST-aware `getUTCOffsetByTimezone(zone, date)` in booking time-bounds validation.
  [`BUG-003`]
- Recurring booking creation batched at 5 concurrent (`Promise.all` bounded). [`BUG-006`]
- `adminList` cursor pagination (`take: limit + 1`, `nextCursor`). [`BUG-101-FORK`]
- Invite email + atomic invite-token consumption. [`SEC-302-FORK`, `BUG-100-FORK`]

### Changed

- `EnvVars`: new `REQUIRE_2FA_FOR_ADMIN`, `MAX_TEAMS_PER_USER` (default 50),
  `MAX_BASE64_IMAGE_BYTES`. See `.env.example`.
- `getCspHeader` accepts a tri-state `{ mode: "enforce" | "report-only" | "off" }` in
  addition to the legacy `{ shouldEnforceCsp }` signature.
- `apps/web/proxy.ts` matcher broadened to cover all page paths for CSP injection.
- Lark / Feishu / Webex calendar+video adapters no longer swallow OAuth errors silently
  (`catch (err) { logger.warn(..., err); throw }`). [`BUG-007`]

### Fixed

- Reset-password token race condition (atomic consume). [`BUG-002`]
- Booking time-zone DST handling at slot boundaries. [`BUG-003`]
- Working-hours DST handling. [`BUG-004`]
- Recurring booking unbounded parallelism. [`BUG-006`]
- Webhook authorization branching (5-line diff vs upstream now isolated in
  `authorization-clever.ts`). [`FORK-300-FORK`]
